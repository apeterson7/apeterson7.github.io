I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Capital One, where I work on approaches to standardization and automation for large scale machine learning projects. I am also pursuing a masters degree in computer science from New York University, focusing on applied machine learning and artificial intelligence. Lately, I have been interested in transformer based language models and their applications to problems in NLP.
